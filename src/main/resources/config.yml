# IMPORTANT: before you put a shulker in a kit or a crate, make sure to hold it in your hand and run /axshulkers clear!
# if this is not done, people will be getting the exact same shulker, and they will share its inventory (probably not what you want)
# you don't need to worry about this, if you enable the 'auto-clear-shulkers' setting!

# EXPERIEMENTAL (this option was well tested, however it is still less safe than the default system)
# this setting will remove the safety UUID from the shulkers after they are closed
# it relies on java WeakReference-s to protect you from dupes
# this also force disables 'enable-obfuscation'

# how often should the plugin save shulker boxes from ram to the database?
# this is in minutes

# if this is on, the plugin won't save items to the shulker item
# this makes it impossible to see what is in the shulker without opening it
# note: this will break the shulker peeking functionality in plugins (like in auction houses or [item] plugins)
# incompatible with auto-clear-shulkers

# when in creative mode, the plugin will not modify any of the shulkers

# note that the plugin will not clean up old ones, so changing this is not recommended
